 * Legalesign.com is an electronic signature software. This is the documentation for its REST API.   Start by creating a trial account at https://app1.legalesign.com/auth/intro/. Upon account activation, select the API dev option.  Get an API key by emailing support@legalesign with background on your use-case and skills. You will need to show experience in API dev.  You will be in sandbox mode that will limit you to 5 signers. Add them on https://app1.legalesign.com/acc/settings/#api. Contact support to move to production mode when you are ready.
